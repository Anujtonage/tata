Hi anuj.... imprompto for git and github.
git is local repositories and used to crack the code changes.it is more popular and easy to use and also open source and scalable platform. 
git is used to first config using  git config --global user.name "username",and config mail like git config --global user.mail "usermail",
workflow is first create  repo . on github then clone the project like commond is git clone using git clone <link> after that we changes the file and then need to add to commit file
using git add filename then your file is ready to staged . use git commit-m "message"
then your project is ready to push on local to github repositories.
commond using git push origin main 

then add new repositories in git and send them to github.
cd directory to main  repo then make mkdir to add directory and then cd to go to new directory.
first check you to git file is available or not then add ls commond to check add file git init ----it is initial stage to add git file,
then git remote add origin <linkk>
to check the remote ----git remote -v
here remote means github repo.
git branch ...check the branches,
git branch branch name ------add the branch 
git branch -m old branch   new branch       rename the branch.
git push  -u origin main      ----->here -u is used means all the pushes one time.



git checkout ------->used to move the path one branch to another one ,
pushing the data on branch ......
git push origin main branch name.
